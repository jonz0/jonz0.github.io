          I've trained Brazilian jiu-jitsu for longer than I've been programming, and there's a lot I love about it. I
          love the tactics and physicality of the sport, I love going to the gym and learning something new,
          I love landing submissions, and I even love working my way out of some really bad spots. The people can be
          alright too. One thing I don't love though, is the internal site everyone at my gym uses to sign up for
          classes. Having a sign up tool is useful for instructors to keep track of things like availability and class
          level, and it's great for students like me to commit to a schedule and keep track of my progress. That being
          said, there are 2 big problems I have with the signup interface that I think could be solved.

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Slow and Boring?</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      My biggest grievance was with the interface itself, which is very slow. This is because signup requests take
      upwards of 5
      seconds to fulfill. Then, adding insult to injury, the entire page is re-rendered, which is especially
      troublesome when signing up on a mobile device, where a page refresh means I need to scroll through hundreds of
      attendees before I reach the class I want at the bottom! I sign up for between 5-10
      classes per week, so putting my name down for the week in advance can be a very frustrating process:

        See how long this takes? Now visualize yourself signing up for 10 classes every week.

    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Second, the site is somewhat bare-bones, and I saw opportunities to bring in useful features for both
      instructors and students. Take the leaderboard for example. Just a few plain text lines are
      allocated to the top performers, and the performance metrics are <i>never</i> reset! Wouldn't it be
      nice
      to show off that you've gone to more classes than anyone this year, including that guy you haven't seen once
      this year but did 500 classes during the Bronze Age?
    </span>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Some additional features I considered implementing included: a user profile page where students can gain
      visibility into their monthly progress, and GUI-level control center for instructors where they could manage and
      update users, classes, and attendees.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Personal Objectives</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">I wanted to challenge myself with learning how to
      use the AWS SDK over Firebase, partly because I wanted to add some tools to my kit and also because I keep hearing
      AWS all the time. I wanted to see what the hype was all about - would I regret using AWS at by the time I
      finished?
    </span>
    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">Another goal; was to make the application more robust
      compared to my previous project, EXIF Mapper. That project was just for me to learn the basics, and I left much of
      it unfinished - things like front-end security, read/write controls, and other business logic. This
      project needed to be useful for real, even though I wasn't sure what I had to do to make that happen. The ultimate
      goal is still learning, though!

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Planning and Discovery</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">The final version if this application was built using JavaScript and
      React, with AWS handling back-end processes including user authentication, data access, and file storage.
    </span>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">I started by creating an informal project spec, which entailed the
      features I needed to build out for the application, as well as any complexities I would need to handle for various
      aspects of the project. Here's what that looked like:
    </p>

    <figure class="figure-container">
      <img src="images/serao/serao-spec.png" class="figure-image" />
    </figure>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Much like with EXIF Mapper, I then identified which tools I needed in order to
      handle back-end stuff, like how the entire data access layer would be organized. Within the AWS kit, I settled
      upon AppSync for managing user/attendee/class information, Cognito for
      user authentication, and S3 for file/images.
    </p>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      During this process, I struggled with designing how to handle a moving range of available class dates that users
      could sign up for. Here's what I mean: each class is tied to a date, but there are an infinite number of future
      dates that can be registered for. Storing an infinite number of classes in my database didn't seem feasible, so I
      figured the application needed to automatically update dates for each class, while simultaneously presenting a
      moving 7-day signup window for users. Similarly, allowing users to view a monthly history of class attendance
      the application needed to automatically update a growing catalogue of classes that is attached to each user.
      These features would later be handled with scheduled AWS Lambda functions that automatically update class
      dates and append new attendance data to users on a daily basis.
    </p>

    <h1 class="takeaways-title" id="title-typeface">Features and Buildout</h1>

    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Once I had the backend design figured out, piecing together the front end was relatively straightforward, save for
      a few challenges around interface design, which I mocked up and experimented with on a notebook and paper as I
      built various pages and features. The more frustrating difficulties came with the backend, the AWS learning curve
      in particular, as I needed to read through specific parts of documentation for AWS AppSync, CloudWatch, Cognito,
      IAM, Lambda, and S3 so I could connect the front-end and back-end using JavaScript.
    </span>

    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Occasionally, I found parts of the AWS documentation to be confusing or unworkable for reasons I couldn't figure
      out at the time, so I leaned upon a few external libraries like amazon-cognito-identity-js to support the parts I
      couldn't get going on my own. </span>

    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">Beyond documentation, here are a few additional workarounds
      and
      learnings I came
      across while building out the main application:</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <li id="body-typeface">
      Global state management with redux: one use case for this arose in the main calendar signup page, where each
      class needed to pass details props to the main page. My initial setup required some serious prop drilling
      (from
      Class -> Day -> main page -> Details component.) Using the Redux store though, details were instead saved
      as a global state so that the Details component could pull them directly and make state changes through the
      details slice. Additionally, I used mapStateToProps to rerender components upon modifying global states (for
      example, the Attendees component is automatically rerendered when the current user changes the details of a
      class by signing up for it.)
    </li>
    <li id="body-typeface">
      Cache busting: when users update their profile image, a new image request is sent to S3 using an Object URL.
      However, because images are cached aggressively in the browser, I appended the current date and timestamp
      <i>Date.now()</i> to the Object URL so that users' updated profile images are reflected immediately upon
      upload.
    </li>
    <li id="body-typeface">
      GraphQL queries, mutations, and schemas: Because the entire data access layer of the application is built
      using
      AppSync which is a GraphQL interface, I picked up the basics of how to design an effective schema with
      nested
      types, and learned the hard way to design my schema in a way that is friendly to future changes (as I found
      myself scrapping and recreating the schema frequently when I planned poorly from the outset.)
    </li>
    <li id="body-typeface">
      NextJS vs. Create React App: Previously, I learned to use React with Create React App. However, I opted for
      NextJS primarily to take
      advantage of server-side rendering when serving updated class and attendance details for users. In addition
      to
      learning the basics of client-side vs. server-side rendering, I also made use of NextJS component-level css,
      which helped me organize and clean up my styling for various elements of the application. Lastly, I enjoyed
      (but
      did not notice) the various optimizations NextJS makes for fonts and images.
    </li>
    </span>


    <h1 class="takeaways-title" id="title-typeface">Takeaways</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">This was by far my most enjoyable project to date, especially
      because the features I built
      or reworked were all ones I would personally find useful as a student at my gym. Most of my struggles and
      bottlenecks during this project came from working with the AWS, mostly due to my initial lack of
      understanding of how each of the AWS services work and how I should implement them in my code. On the flip
      side,
      building the front-end was also challenging
      because of the volume of feature requirements I had planned from the outset. Reworking various features
      based on
      user feedback was also tedious, but a necessary step in ensuring that the actual user experience was
      function for
      both instructors and students.
