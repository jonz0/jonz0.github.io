          I've trained Brazilian jiu-jitsu for longer than I've been programming, and there's a lot I love about it. I
          love the tactics and physicality of the sport, I love going to the gym and learning something new,
          I love landing submissions, and I even love working my way out of some really bad spots. The people can be
          alright too. One thing I don't love though, is the internal site everyone at my gym uses to sign up for
          classes. Having a sign up tool is useful for instructors to keep track of things like availability and class
          level, and it's great for students like me to commit to a schedule and keep track of my progress. That being
          said, there are 2 big problems I have with the signup interface that I think could be solved.

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Slow and Boring?</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      My primary grievance was with the interface itself, which is very slow. This is because signup requests take
      upwards of 5
      seconds to fulfill. Then, adding insult to injury, the entire page is re-rendered, which is especially
      troublesome when signing up on a mobile device, where a page refresh means I need to scroll through hundreds of
      attendees before I reach the class I want at the bottom! I sign up for between 5-10
      classes per week, so putting my name down for the week in advance can be a very frustrating process:

      <figcaption class="figure-caption-center">
        See how long this takes? Now visualize yourself signing up for 10 classes every week.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Second, the site is somewhat bare-bones, and I saw opportunities to bring in useful features for both
      instructors and students. Take the leaderboard for example. Just a few plain text lines are
      allocated to the top performers, and the performance metrics are <i>never</i> reset! Wouldn't it be
      nice
      to show off that you've gone to more classes than anyone this year, including that guy you haven't seen once
      this year but did 500 classes during the Bronze Age?
    </span>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Some additional features I considered implementing included: a user profile page where students can gain
      visibility into their monthly progress, and GUI-level control center for instructors where they could manage and
      update users, classes, and attendees.
    </p>

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Personal Objectives</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">I wanted to challenge myself with learning how to
      use the AWS SDK over Firebase, partly because I wanted to add some tools to my kit and also because I keep hearing
      AWS all the time. I wanted to see what the hype was all about - would I regret using AWS at by the time I
      finished?
    </span>
    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">Another goal; was to make the application more robust
      compared to my previous project, EXIF Mapper. That project was just for me to learn the basics, and I left much of
      it unfinished - things like front-end security, read/write controls, and other business logic. This
      project needed to be useful for real, even though I wasn't sure what I had to do to make that happen. The ultimate
      goal is still learning, though!
    </p>

    <br />

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Planning and Discovery</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">The final version if this application was built using JavaScript and
      React, with AWS handling back-end processes including user authentication, data access, and file storage.
    </span>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">I started by creating an informal project spec, which entailed the
      features I needed to build out for the application, as well as any complexities I would need to handle for various
      aspects of the project. Here's what that looked like:
    </p>

    <figure class="figure-container">
      <img src="images/serao/serao-spec.png" class="figure-image" />
    </figure>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Then, much like with EXIF Mapper, I bean the discovery phase where I identified the tools necessary
      for handling the back-end, as well as how I would structure the data access layer of the entire
      application. Within the AWS kit, I settled upon AppSync for managing user/attendee/class information, Cognito for
      user authentication, and S3 for file/images.
    </p>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      One thing I struggled with was planning out how my application would handle a moving range of available class
      signup dates. This gym could conceivably last forever, and I needed users to be able to sign up for classes that
      exist 50 years from now, even though they are only able to register 7 days in advance. Storing an infinite number
      of classes that could be registered for in the back-end didn't make sense to me, so I needed to find another
      solution. Similarly, I planned for users to be able to view a history of their class attendance, which meant that
      the amount of class data attached to each user grows each day and couldn't be stored like a key-value pair in a
      user object.
    </p>

    <h1 class="takeaways-title" id="title-typeface">Takeaways</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">This was my first introduction to software design; instead of coding
      to
      meet a list of predefined requirements, I had to preemptively think
      about designing in a way that is structured, well-organized, fast, and
      flexible so I can develop new features without getting lost. I spent -
      and wasted - a lot of time working and reworking both my design and
      implementation, which helped me build a strong mental framework for
      setting up larger, more complex projects.
