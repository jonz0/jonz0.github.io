          Gitlet is a part of UC Berkeley's CS 61B: Data Structures, and is
          typically the first assigned project without skeleton code. This was
          a challenging project that exposed me to software design principles
          including decomposition, abstraction, and flexibility. I implemented
          file persistence, graph traversals, and cryptographic hashing so
          Gitlet could mimic how the real Git manages repositories, branches,
          and version history.

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">My Approach</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">Without a project skeleton, I planned ahead by diagramming how my
      implementation of Gitlet should look. To figure out how Git stores
      things like head commits, branches, and logs, I explored .git in my own
      repositories and came up with a modified structure that looks like this:
    </span>
    <div class="gitlet-structure">
      <img src="images/gitlet-diagram.png" class="gitlet-diagram" />
      <span class="gitlet-text" id="body-typeface">
        All repository information (e.g. current head, staging area, blobs,
        branches, commits, and remote repositories) is saved in a .gitlet
        file. Commits and blobs are assigned a UUID using SHA-1, serialized,
        and stored in the objects folder. To speed up object traversal,
        objects are packaged in folders named by the first two digits of their
        UUID, similar to Git.
      </span>
    </div>

    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Once I had a roadmap to follow, I implemented each command one by one:

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Challenges</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">Project design: Planning Gitlet's design was not a straightforward
      process. Methodically cycling between learning, planning, and coding
      helped me locate design flaws, plan ahead, and continuously iterate
      until my implementation aligned perfectly with the intended design.
    </span>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Checkout, merge, and fetch: These commands involve altering the working
      directory based on information pulled from commit histories. For
      example, the command merge behaves differently based on the earliest
      split point of the given branches. For these commands to work, I treated
      commit histories as directed acyclic graphs so I could easily traverse
      them in reverse level order. My implementation involved using hashmaps,
      linked lists, and unordered sets to store and retrieve information
      during traversals.
    </p>
    <figure class="figure-container">
      <img src="images/gitlet-merge.png" class="figure-image" />
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        Example of LCA in the merge command: Gitlet finds the latest common
        ancestor of two commits in O(n) time (where n represents the number of
        parents of each branch head) by running DFS to find all parents of
        commit A, then matching those commits with each parent of commit B.
        Every shared commit is a split point, and the LCA is the split point
        with the greatest depth. Gitlet avoids calculating node depths during
        merge by memoizing depth each time a new commit is saved.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Testing and debugging: Gitlet was particularly challenging because each
      command relies upon the proper functionality of the other commands (for
      example, fetching a remote branch is impossible if the remote repository
      is improperly initialized.) I unit tested rigorously to ensure that
      early bugs did not permeate later code, and found myself spending as
      much time writing tests as I did coding up the main content. My
      poorly-written tests often led me astray; my well-written ones were
      crucial for clarifying key invariables and managing complexity.
    </p>

    <h1 class="takeaways-title" id="title-typeface">Takeaways</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">This was my first introduction to software design; instead of coding
      to
      meet a list of predefined requirements, I had to preemptively think
      about designing in a way that is structured, well-organized, fast, and
      flexible so I can develop new features without getting lost. I spent -
      and wasted - a lot of time working and reworking both my design and
      implementation, which helped me build a strong mental framework for
      setting up larger, more complex projects.
