                <p class="about-body-1"> I'm a 2021 graduate living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Right out of college,
                    I set off in early-stage investing, corporate networking, and business strategy - as I have always been 
                    inspired by unknown founders who end up building great things. In pursuit of my own
                    great thing, I bean experimenting with software development just under a year ago. 
                    It feels like I'm barely staying afloat right now, but I'm treading relentlessly, and I look forward to 
                    discovering the people and opportunities that lie ahead. 
                </p>

                <p class="about-body-2"> My work has always involved sharing and receiving information
                    from other people, so my belief in ongoing feedback and challenging opinions is woven into my own
                    process for working and iterating on projects. Although I'm a relatively inexperienced developer, I have
                    a passion for creating useful things with my own two hands, and I comfortably drop into my flow state
                    when I'm piecing together something that's right in front of me. It took me five years to realize this, so
                    I'm determined to capitalize on every chance I have to improve as a creator & developer.
                </p>

                <p class="about-body-3"> Outside of work, you'll find me getting my ass kicked in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, handing it right
                    back in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and finally catching some green waves at a beach nearby - regretting each of my 
                    18 years living in San Diego that I didn't start surfing sooner.
