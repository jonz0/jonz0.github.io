                <p class="about-body-1"> I'm a 2021 graduate living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Right out of college,
                    I set off into business strategy and early-stage venture capital - driven by my enthusiasm for
                    unknown founders who end up building great things. In pursuit of
                    my own great thing, I began experimenting with software development just under a year ago. 
                    I feel like I'm barely keeping afloat, but I'm treading relentlessly, and I'm eager to discover 
                    the opportunities that lie ahead. 
                </p>

                <p class="about-body-2"> My work has always involved sharing information with other people, so my belief in 
                    ongoing feedback and challenging opinions is woven into my process for creating new things. Although I'm 
                    relatively inexperienced, I have a passion for creating - I effortlessly drop into flow when I'm piecing 
                    together something that people like me can interact with. It took me five years to realize this, which 
                    makes me pretty hyped to get moving.
                </p>

                <p class="about-body-3"> When I want a break, I'm usually getting my ass kicked in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, handing it 
                    right back in Super Smash Bros., or finally catching some green waves at a beach nearby - regretting each of 
                    my 18 years living in San Diego that I didn't start surfing sooner.
