                <p class="breakdown-text">
                    Gitlet is a part of UC Berkeley's CS 61B: Data Structures, and is typically the first assigned project without skeleton code. 
                    This was a challenging project that exposed me to software design principles including decomposition, abstraction, and flexibility. 
                    I implemented file persistence, graph traversals, and cryptographic hashing so Gitlet could mimic how the real Git manages repositories, 
                    branches, and version history.

                <h1 class="breakdown-title">My Approach</h1>
                <p class="breakdown-text">Without a project skeleton, I planned ahead by diagramming how my implementation of Gitlet should look. To figure out how Git stores things like
                    head commits, branches, and logs, I explored .git in my own repositories and came up with a modified structure that looks like this:
                </p>
                <div class="gitlet-structure">
                    <img src="images/gitlet-diagram.png" class="gitlet-diagram">
                    <p class="gitlet-text"> All repository information (e.g. current head, staging area, blobs, branches, commits, and remote repositories) is saved in a .gitlet file. 
                        Commits and blobs are assigned a UUID using SHA-1, serialized, and stored in the objects folder. To speed up object traversal, objects are packaged in folders
                        named by the first two digits of their UUID, similar to Git.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="gitlet-text-hidden"> All repository information (e.g. current head, staging area, blobs, branches, commits, and remote repositories) is saved in a .gitlet file.

                <h1 class="breakdown-title">Challenges</h1>
                <p class="breakdown-text">Project design: Planning Gitlet's design was not a straightforward process. Methodically cycling between
                    learning, planning, and coding helped me locate design flaws, plan ahead, and continuously iterate until my
                    implementation aligned perfectly with the intended design.
                </p>

                <p class="breakdown-text">Checkout, merge, and fetch: These commands involve altering the working directory based on information pulled from commit histories.
                    For example, the command merge behaves differently based on the earliest split point of the given branches. For these commands to work, I treated commit histories as directed acyclic graphs
                    so I could easily traverse them in reverse level order. My implementation involved using hashmaps, linked lists, and unordered sets
                    to store and retrieve information during traversals.
                </p>
                <figure class="project-figure">
                    <img src="images/gitlet-merge.png" class="gitlet-merge">
                    <figcaption class="fig-caption">Example of LCA in the merge command: Gitlet finds the latest common ancestor of two commits in O(n) time (where n represents the number of parents
                        of each branch head) by running DFS to find all parents of commit A, then matching those commits with each parent of commit B. Every shared 
                        commit is a split point, and the LCA is the split point with the greatest depth. Gitlet avoids calculating commit node depths when merging by amortizing the calculation
                        each time a new commit is saved. </figcaption>
                </figure> 

                <p class="breakdown-text">Testing and debugging: Gitlet was particularly challenging because each command relies upon the proper functionality of the other commands (for example, 
                    fetching a remote branch is impossible if the remote repository is improperly initialized.) I rigorously unit tested elements
                    to ensure that undiscovered bugs did not permeate the rest of my code, and I found myself spending as much time
                    writing tests as I did coding up the main content. My poorly-written tests often led me astray, and my well-written ones were crucial to helping me clarify key invariables and manage overall complexity.
                </p>

                <h1 class="breakdown-title">Takeaways</h1>
                <p class="breakdown-text">This was my first introduction to software design; instead of coding to meet a list of predefined requirements, I had to preemptively think about designing
                    in a way that is structured, well-organized, fast, and flexible so I can develop new features without getting lost. I spent - and wasted - a lot of time working and reworking
                    both my design and implementation, which helped me learn how to not waste time when programming larger projects.
