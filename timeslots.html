          I've trained Brazilian jiu-jitsu for longer than I've been programming, and there's a lot I love about it. I
          love the tactics and physicality of the sport, I love going to the gym and learning something new,
          I love landing submissions, and I even love working my way out of some really bad spots. The people can be
          alright too. One thing I don't love though, is the internal site everyone at my gym uses to sign up for
          classes. Having a sign up tool is useful for instructors to keep track of things like availability and class
          level, and it's great for students like me to commit to a schedule and keep track of my progress. That being
          said, there are 2 big problems I have with the signup interface that I think could be solved.

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Slow and Boring?</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      First, the actual interface is really slow. Besides the borderline psychotic page loading times, my big issue is
      that the requests generated by signing up for a class take a while to process, sometimes upwards of
      10 seconds. Furthermore, each time a button is pressed, the entire page is re-rendered. This is especially
      troublesome when signing up on a mobile device, where a page refresh means I need to scroll through tens of
      classes with hundreds of attendees before I reach the class I want at the bottom. I sign up for between 5-10
      classes per week, so putting my name down for the week in advance can be a really annoying process.
    </span>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Second, the site is kind of boring. Take the leaderboard, for example: just a few plain text lines are
      allocated to the top performers, not to mention that performance metrics are never reset! Wouldn't it be nice
      to show off that you've gone to more classes than anyone this month, including the guy you haven't seen once
      this year but did 500 classes during the Bronze Age?
    </p>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Leaderboard aside, I also wanted to bring in some additional features so that users gain more visibility into
      their monthly progress, and admins have GUI-level control over users, attendees, and classes all in the same
      application.
    </p>

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">My Approach</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">Without a project skeleton, I planned ahead by diagramming how my
      implementation of Gitlet should look. To figure out how Git stores
      things like head commits, branches, and logs, I explored .git in my own
      repositories and came up with a modified structure that looks like this:
    </span>
    <div class="gitlet-structure">
      <img src="images/gitlet-diagram.png" class="gitlet-diagram" />
      <span class="gitlet-text" id="body-typeface">
        All repository information (e.g. current head, staging area, blobs,
        branches, commits, and remote repositories) is saved in a .gitlet
        file. Commits and blobs are assigned a UUID using SHA-1, serialized,
        and stored in the objects folder. To speed up object traversal,
        objects are packaged in folders named by the first two digits of their
        UUID, similar to Git.
      </span>
    </div>

    <h1 class="breakdown-title" id="title-typeface">Challenges</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">Project design: Planning Gitlet's design was not a straightforward
      process. Methodically cycling between learning, planning, and coding
      helped me locate design flaws, plan ahead, and continuously iterate
      until my implementation aligned perfectly with the intended design.
    </span>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Checkout, merge, and fetch: These commands involve altering the working
      directory based on information pulled from commit histories. For
      example, the command merge behaves differently based on the earliest
      split point of the given branches. For these commands to work, I treated
      commit histories as directed acyclic graphs so I could easily traverse
      them in reverse level order. My implementation involved using hashmaps,
      linked lists, and unordered sets to store and retrieve information
      during traversals.
    </p>
    <figure class="figure-container">
      <img src="images/gitlet-merge.png" class="figure-image" />
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        Example of LCA in the merge command: Gitlet finds the latest common
        ancestor of two commits in O(n) time (where n represents the number of
        parents of each branch head) by running DFS to find all parents of
        commit A, then matching those commits with each parent of commit B.
        Every shared commit is a split point, and the LCA is the split point
        with the greatest depth. Gitlet avoids calculating node depths during
        merge by memoizing depth each time a new commit is saved.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">
      Testing and debugging: Gitlet was particularly challenging because each
      command relies upon the proper functionality of the other commands (for
      example, fetching a remote branch is impossible if the remote repository
      is improperly initialized.) I unit tested rigorously to ensure that
      early bugs did not permeate later code, and found myself spending as
      much time writing tests as I did coding up the main content. My
      poorly-written tests often led me astray; my well-written ones were
      crucial for clarifying key invariables and managing complexity.
    </p>

    <h1 class="takeaways-title" id="title-typeface">Takeaways</h1>
    <span class="breakdown-text" id="body-typeface">This was my first introduction to software design; instead of coding
      to
      meet a list of predefined requirements, I had to preemptively think
      about designing in a way that is structured, well-organized, fast, and
      flexible so I can develop new features without getting lost. I spent -
      and wasted - a lot of time working and reworking both my design and
      implementation, which helped me build a strong mental framework for
      setting up larger, more complex projects.
